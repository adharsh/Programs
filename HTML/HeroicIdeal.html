		<h4>What is the Heroic Ideal?</h4>
		<div>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heroic Ideal represents the qualities of a character who is perceptive of his or her environment and struggles to resolve his or her predicaments. The hero understands the complexities of the present situation and goes to the extent to ultimately sacrifice him or herself in order to promote his or her cause.

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ender Wiggins, the protagonist of Ender’s Game, represents the heroic ideal. Ender understands that humanity hardly emerged victorious from the first Bugger War and that humanity will face the alien buggers once more.  In order to prevent any catastrophic outcomes from the defeat of humanity in the next Bugger War, Ender fights and trains at the International Fleet (I.F.). Ender struggles at the academy yet persists on winning each and every battle because he understands that in the end, defeating the buggers in the next war is what he is really doing it for. He continues to train for this reason even after reaching exerting his mind and his body to the limit.

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harrison Bergeron is a character of a futuristic society in which it is a crime to have qualities that are superior to others. Therefore, any forms of talent are hindered and concealed. Harrison is a gifted man who is very exceptional and far greater than any common, ordinary man. The government imposes and inhibits his true potential by forcing him to be more unappealing and putting excessive weights on him to make him have the strength of typical man. Harrison understands that the government is restricting him, and he attempts to resolve his predicament by proving and displaying his greatness to society, in an effort to regain control of himself and free society from the government. He takes a grand risk to do this, and it costs him his life to prove his point.

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon exemplifies the heroic ideal. Simon, out of all of the boys on the island, is the first to understand that the beast is actually within themselves and not some external force. He also is the first to understand that through encountering the Lord of the Flies, or the Pig’s head, that the evil is inherent in all of the boys on the island. As Simon tells the other boys of his discovery (that the true identity of the beast is within all of them), the boys murder him. Simon pays the ultimate cost to address and resolve the problem of the evil present in all of them.
