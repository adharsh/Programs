				Future growth in computing performance will have to come from
parallelism. Most software developers today think and program by
using a sequential programming model to create software for single generalpurpose
microprocessors. The microprocessor industry has already begun
to deliver parallel hardware in mainstream products with chip multiprocessors
(CMPs—sometimes referred to as multicore), an approach
that places new burdens on software developers to build applications
to take advantage of multiple, distinct cores. Although developers have
found reasonable ways to use two or even four cores effectively by running
independent tasks on each one, they have not, for the most part,
parallelized individual tasks in such a way as to make full use of the
available computational capacity. Moreover, if industry continues to follow
the same trends, they will soon be delivering chips with hundreds
of cores. Harnessing these cores will require new techniques for parallel
computing, including breakthroughs in software models, languages, and
tools. </br />Developers of both hardware and software will need to focus more
attention on overall system performance, likely at the expense of time to
market and the efficiency of the virtuous cycle described previously.
